# agentic-gcp-infra-automation
A Python-powered Agentic AI script that uses Google Gemini, LangChain, and Terraform to provision GCP infrastructure using natural language prompts ‚Äî complete with auto-generated Ansible playbooks and full deployment.

# Agentic GCP Infra Automation üöÄ

This project demonstrates how to use **Agentic AI**, **LangChain**, and **Google Gemini** to fully automate GCP infrastructure provisioning from **natural language prompts**.

## üß† What It Does

- Accepts plain English prompts (e.g., ‚ÄúProvision 2 Ubuntu VMs on GCP...‚Äù)
- Uses Gemini + LangChain to:
  - Generate Terraform code for GCP
  - Generate Ansible playbooks for server configuration
  - Critique and validate both
- Automatically:
  - Saves code to disk
  - Runs `terraform apply`
  - Extracts IPs from state
  - Runs `ansible-playbook`

## üí¨ Example Prompt

```text
Provision 2 Ubuntu 22.04 VMs in GCP using e2-micro machine type inside a new VPC called vpc-001 in which you create a new subnet called subnet-001 which uses IP address range 10.10.10.0/24. Assign both VMs internal IPs 10.10.10.100 and 10.10.10.101. Also, on VM1 install nginx and on VM2 install mariadb. The SSH authorized key should be for user abanand ‚Äî who should be in sudoers and whose password should be "Cat4Dog!". Ports 22, 80, 443 and ICMP should be allowed for these VMs.
